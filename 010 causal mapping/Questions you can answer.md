Looking at Marina and Tom's causal pathways "Questions" (for the CP training - below) - they never really talk about the fundamental property and challenge of a causal map which is transitivity or tracing. From a-->b and b --> c concluding, (maybe, but when and how?), a --> c. They just never address the question.  But if you werent interested in this fundamental property & challenge, why would you use a map or talk about a pathway??

Causal questions that fit within this overarching question may focus on exploring causal pathways or on assessing impact. Apgar and Aston categorize them as follows and provide the following examples: 
	
Causal Process Questions: 
● What specific processes led to the observed outcomes? 
● How did the intervention trigger change? 
● What intermediate mechanisms connect the intervention to outcomes? 
	
Causal Context Questions: 
● How do different contexts modify the causal mechanism? 
● What contextual conditions enable or inhibit causal effects? 
● How do local factors interact with intervention strategies? 
	
Emergent Causality Questions: 
● How do unintended consequences emerge? 
● What unexpected causal pathways developed? 
● How do multiple factors interact to produce outcomes? 
	
Comparative Causal Questions: 
● Which intervention strategy was most effective in creating change? 
● How do different approaches compare in terms of causal impact? 
● What are the differential effects of alternative interventions? 
	
Equity Focused Questions: 
● How did causal effects differ across social groups? 
● What variations in impact existed? 
● Did the intervention affect different populations differently? 
	
Systemic Causality Questions: 
● How did the intervention contribute to systemic changes? 
● What broader transformations were triggered? 
● How do multiple levels of the system interact causally? 
	
Impact Contribution and Inquiry Questions: 
● To what extent did the intervention cause the observed changes? 
● What difference did the program make compared to doing nothing? 
● How much of the observed outcome can be directly attributed to the intervention?
