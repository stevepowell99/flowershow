Attitude can cover  areas including perceptions, emotions, opinions, knowledge, assumptions, beliefs, values
Attitude Changes are internal and therefore invisible. This distinguishes them 
from behavior changes, which are external and therefore observable. 

A Behavior Change Statement is one unit of data within an OH+AC data set. It includes not only the description of a 
behavior change but also its significance, contribution details and related attitude change. (In mainstream OH, this is called 
an Outcome Statement.)

Behavior Change. (An Attitude Change is not considered an outcome because it is not observable.) 


AC data can add significant value to OH in two situations:
• Where attitude change is essential to achieving program results – because, in such situations, considering attitudes in 
evaluation is a key aspect of understanding how social change happens. 
• Where attitudes are central to the worldview of the program implementers or social actors – because, in such 
situations, considering attitudes can help to enhance cultural responsiveness and multicultural validity.

Systems theory pioneer Donella Meadows defines 
mental models broadly, including assumptions, values and beliefs. In other words, “mental models” in systems theory hold 
roughly the same meaning as “attitudes” in OH+AC (and in social psychology). Meadows argues that mental models are not 
just any part of the system, but actually the most influential part of the system. Mental models may be the most strategic 
place to intervene within a system in order to change it.1

UT I WAS PUZZLED BY

Sample OH+AC Questions for Progress Tracking or Evaluation
....• What significant ACs have been identified? To what extent do they indicate progress toward the program’s 
long-term aims?

THIS HAS CONSEQUENCES

C. However, OH+AC carries an added requirement to communicate with some or all of the 
social actors influenced by the program, because they are the only ones who can verify or clarify the ACs that they have 
experienced. This can


In OH+AC, you will add ACs as an additional component of the BC Statement. This changes absolutely nothing in terms 
of the centrality of BCs as the anchor of the BC Statement. Ho
