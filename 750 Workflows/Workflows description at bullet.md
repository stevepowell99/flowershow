## Causal Map Workflows:  
Use AI to make sense of mountains of texts — rigorously and verifiably

### **What is** **[Workflows](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nexgcqgtK-nTThCot7f35An1TRi3tdp4i4ZrHoPnfbc/edit?usp=sharing)****?**

Workflows is a tool used by Causal Map Ltd to make sense of large amounts of text data (interviews, reports) supported by generative AI.

At the moment, use of Workflows is not open for public use. Instead, we use it internally to provide verifiable and transparent analysis and reporting to clients. Clients can then access their workflows in the app to view and, if they wish, verify each step.

### **Which questions can Workflows help answer?**

- All of the [Questions You Can Answer with Causal Mapping](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13ZQ2bj1DCWN3p-kuSq97CUFsvkdTtok_&usp=drive_fs), for example:

- Causal pathways
- New, emerging and unexpected factors and outcomes
- Project impact through the eyes of stakeholders and other sources
- Contribution of projects to outcomes
- QuIP: Synthesis of Qualitative Impact Protocol evaluations
- OH: Synthesis of Outcome Harvesting processes
- MSC: Synthesis of stories collected for Most Significant Change processes
- Comparisons between groups and time-points
- Vignettes: which stories are both remarkable and frequent?

- More generally, any kind of question you can answer by analysing text systematically, reproducibly and verifiably, page by page or paragraph by paragraph:

- Stakeholders’ mental models
- Social Network Analysis
- Thematic Analysis

### **What are the benefits?**

- **Scalability:** Process large amounts of text data quickly and efficiently.

- **Transparent & Verifiable Results:** Based on a clear, reproducible audit trail.

- **Include more voices:** Not just small samples of the easily accessible ones.

### **For Evaluators and Contractors**

- **Enhanced Bids:** Offer state-of-the-art techniques to make your proposals more competitive.

- **Time & Cost Savings:** Reduce manual coding and analysis efforts.

- **Reproducible Workflows:** Guarantee that analysis steps are documented and repeatable.

###  Why is Workflows better than tools like ChatGPT or NotebookLM?

- break down big, vague tasks into small, easy ones so that we don’t leave the AI to make big judgements all on its own

- use a clear set of basic tools for each of those small, easy steps

- speed up and automate the application of hundreds of steps like prompts and filters

- manage and keep track of your work so you know exactly what you did last year, and can reproduce the same results in the same way.

### **Why Causal Map Ltd?**

- Innovation in qualitative analysis and reporting

- Broad experience in evaluation and social science research.
