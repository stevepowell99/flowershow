# Comparing a Fine-Tuned Model to an Engineered Prompt in the Context of Causal Connections in a Passage of Text

Samuel Goddard, a student at the MSc in Data Science at the University of Bath compared the performance of a fine-tuned OpenAI model and an engineered prompt in identifying causal connections within text passages to determine the more effective approach for automating this task for Causal Map's software.
