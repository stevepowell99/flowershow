The Causal Map team has conducted a trial of an innovative approach to securing feedback from students using online open-ended interviews conducted by the app [QualiaInterviews](https://qualia-interviews.bullet.site/home/), which uses generative AI (gen-AI), followed by a second use of gen-AI within the app **Causal Map** to semi-automate causal coding of the narrative transcripts thereby generated. The trial was conducted with students registered on the doctorate in policy research and practice (DPRP) at the **University of Bath.** 

This generated credible evidence of diverse positive and negative drivers of learning from eleven students. The trial suggests that incorporation of gen-AI into causal mapping of narrative data about studentsâ€™ study experiences enhances the potential to use the method cost-effectively on a larger scale, whether alongside or instead of more traditional approaches to eliciting student feedback on teaching and learning.
