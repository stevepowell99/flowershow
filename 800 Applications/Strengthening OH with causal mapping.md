Enhance Outcome Harvesting analysis with AI-assisted Causal Mapping! This new [Causal Pathways](https://www.causalpathways.org/) case study is the story of how we collaborated with [Heather Britt](https://heatherbritt.com/) to explore ways to strengthen the analysis of causal relationships in Outcome Harvesting.

Our pilot demonstrated that AI-assisted Causal Mapping can reveal interrelationships between outcomes and identify new actors contributing to change. 

âœ… We describe the pilot process

âœ… Explain how we interpreted the findings

âœ… And share five practical tips

ðŸ’¡ A principle-led analysis plan and the right human expertise are key to in guiding the use of AI in analysis.

Please reach out if youâ€™d like to learn more about how approach might strengthen your Outcome Harvest or other qualitative analysis tasks.

Thanks to Heather and the great folks at the Causal Pathways Initiative (Jewlya Lynn, Carolina De La Rosa Mateo)
