Exploring how AI can be used in qualitative data analysis Ethical Considerations The ethical landscape of generative AI in academia is complex, touching on issues of transparency, data privacy, and intellectual property, among others. The aim of this section is to provide a detailed overview of the ethical considerations that researchers must navigate when employing generative AI technologies in their work. Before employing human-augmenting tools such as LLMs for academic research, graduate students should consult with their academic chairs or supervisors. This step is not only a matter of procedural integrity but also one of ethical transparency to ensure that the rationale behind the use of such tools is clearly articulated and approved.” ([Parker et al., 2023, p. 3462](zotero://select/library/items/IQBAN7Y6))
