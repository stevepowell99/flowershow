The key distinction between agent-based and agentic AI in 2025 comes down to **architecture versus behavior**.
?
- **Agent-based AI** refers to the system's **structure**. It describes an architecture where a system is built from multiple, independent software components called "agents." These agents have their own states and interact with each other to solve a larger problem. Think of it as a team of specialized workers, each with a specific role.
?
- **Agentic AI** refers to the system's **behavior**. It describes an AI that exhibits a high degree of **autonomy, proactivity, and goal-directed reasoning**. An agentic system doesn't just respond to direct commands; it can understand a high-level goal, break it down into steps, make decisions, adapt to new information, and act independently to achieve that goal. 
?
- In essence, a system can be constructed with an agent-based architecture but not be particularly "agentic" if its components only follow simple, predefined rules. Conversely, a single, monolithic AI model can be highly "agentic" if it demonstrates autonomous, goal-driven behavior.
