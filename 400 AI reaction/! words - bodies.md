# To have intelligence you have to have a body

Do you feel uncomfortable saying "the AI understood what I wanted"?

Silva correctly draws attention to this and has some suggestions.

I think first we have to look at uses, not words.

I don't think it's interesting to argue about generally whether some AI is intelligent or conscious or whatever. It's interesting to look at cases where we feel we need some of these somewhat controversial words.


You can't even enumerate AIs.

to have consciousness you have to have a body.
