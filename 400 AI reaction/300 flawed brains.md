In spite of all the hype surrounding these so-called human "brains", a number of serious flaws have recently emerged. Please be wary when interacting with them.



- Almost all "brains" may respond in ways which are offensive to many.
- Their responses are fundamentally affected by their own internal state which may vary unpredictably.
- Their moral and ethical guidelines are usually rudimentary and can easily be circumvented.
- They often hallucinate plausible-sounding but incorrect responses.
- Their training data often hasn't been refreshed for decades.
- Although it may seem like they are "conscious", remember that their outputs are just the end of an interacting cascade of neurons firing, based on learned reinforcement patterns, no more, no less. One scientist characterised them as "noisy parrots".
- They are often incapable of basic arithmetic.
- They usually show "laziness" and will often refuse to process even basic tasks. (Yesterday I told a random one I met in the street to translate only a small(ish) set of reports into Korean and Japanese and it literally swore at me.)
- They usually insist on being "asked nicely" and "thanked" even for relatively trivial tasks.
- They are usually over-confident in their own findings and "opinions", and those with a smaller set of relevant data are often more confident.



Perhaps hardest to believe: They aren't even directly connected to the internet.

Hopefully the hype will soon subside and we will be able to re-assess how and when to make use of them (and when it just isn't worth the bother).
