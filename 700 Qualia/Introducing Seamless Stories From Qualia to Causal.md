# Introducing Seamless Stories: From Qualia to Causal Map

Invite your respondents to an **open-ended interview** guided by our conversational research chatbot, QualiaInterviews. Itâ€™s as easy as an online questionnaire, but you capture richer, unexpected stories.  

Then, understand the stories at scale using the AI power of the Causal Map app.  

This seamless, end-to-end solution can provide rigorous and reproducible insights.
