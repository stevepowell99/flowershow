Fully qualitative surveys, which prioritise qualitative research values, and harness the rich potential of qualitative data, have much to offer qualitative researchers, especially given online delivery options. Yet the method remains underutilised, and there is little in the way of methodological discussion of qualitative surveys. Underutilisation and limited methodological discussion perhaps reflect the dominance of interviewing in qualitative research, and (misplaced) assumptions about qualitative survey data lacking depth. By discussing our experiences of developing online surveys as a tool for qualitative research, we seek to challenge preconceptions about qualitative surveys, and to demonstrate that qualitative surveys are an exciting, flexible method with numerous applications, and advantages for researchers and participants alike. We offer an overview and practical design information, illustrated with examples from some of our studies.

qualitative survey data capture what is important to participants, and access their language and terminology – both frequently claimed advantages of qualitative research (Frith, 2000). Yet qualitative surveys remain a relatively novel and often invisible or side-lined method (e. [(p. 2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=2&annotation=highlight-p2x48y115)

Some think that qualitative surveys must be supplemented with interviews to provide data of adequate depth and richness. In a context where surveys are typically used in large-scale (quantitative or mixed methods) research, they can at frst encounter appear ill suited to the small-scale and situated samples qualitative social research often centres. But this is not the case [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=3&annotation=highlight-p3x48y532)

Qualitative surveys ofer one thing that is fairly unique within qualitative data collection methods – a ‘wide-angle lens’ on the topic of interest (Toerien & Wilkinson, 2004) that provides the potential to capture a diversity of perspectives, experiences, or sense-making (Braun et al., 2017b). This diversity is about hearing a range of voices and sense-making, something especially useful when researching an unor under-explored area – which all the example studies did. In Study 1, a wide-angle lens allowed EB to identify numerous unanticipated avenues for [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=4&annotation=highlight-p4x48y520)

This wide scope is also useful when the population of interest is large, diverse, or indeed unknown. Or when perspectives from diferent groups within a wider population are sought. [(p. 4)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=4&annotation=highlight-p4x48y471)

However, while qualitative surveys are positive for inclusion and participants in many ways, an obvious disadvantage is that they require literacy and risk excluding participants with limited literacy skills – though reassuring participants that they need not be concerned about correct spelling or grammar can address this to some extent (Braun & Clarke, 2013; Terry & Braun, 2017). Similarly, given the widely recognized ‘digital divide’ (Hargittai, 2011; Van Deursen & Van Dijk, 2019), online delivery risks inadvertently excluding some of the least privileged and most vulnerable groups in society. Such factors need to be considered during design [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=5&annotation=highlight-p5x48y544)

Online qualitative surveys are ideally suited to sensitive research [(p. 5)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=5&annotation=highlight-p5x182y75)

The ‘anonymous’ mode of responding may also mean participants feel comfortable ‘talking back’ to the researcher, expressing views on survey design, question wording or perceived researcher agenda (Braun et al., 2017b; Terry & Braun, 2017) [(p. 7)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=7&annotation=highlight-p7x48y376)

Length is an important survey design consideration, both overall length, and the number of topicbased questions. Qualitative surveys often ask very few topic-based questions, such as four (Barrett, 2007; Frith & Gleeson, 2004, 2008) or six [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=9&annotation=highlight-p9x48y256)

all the (increasing) detail researchers are required to include as participant information can mean that participants do not read it all, or at all – but there is no easy way to navigate this. Such information cannot be left out for the sake of brevity. But some participants are likely to complete the survey without having read some or any of the participant information. The pragmatic challenge this provides12 can be partly managed by locating key completion instructions before the frst (main) question. Such information might include: reassurance around spelling and grammar; encouraging use of emojis to express emotion [(p. 9)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=9&annotation=highlight-p9x47y39)

question of sample size for qualitative surveys is not simple (Braun & Clarke, 2013 provided some ‘rules of thumb’ for student projects). Samples are usually larger than typical for qualitative studies: ranging from a lower end of 20–49 (e.g., Barrett, 2007; Clarke & Smith, 2015; Clarke & Spence, 2013; Grogan & Mechan, 2017; Grogan et al., 2018; Hayfeld, 2013) to a mid-range of 60–99 (e.g., Braun et al., 2013; Clarke, 2016, 2019; Frith & Gleeson, 2004, 2008; Peel, 2010) and an upper end of well over one hundred [(p. 10)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/45GFD7IU?page=10&annotation=highlight-p10x48y186)

people with alopecia (Davey, 2019). The more structured data generated by qualitative surveys compared to – say – interviews can seduce researchers into summarizing the responses to each question and dubbing these ‘themes’. We urge users of qualitative surveys to resist any temptation to summarize responses to each question, as this typically results in an impoverished and underdeveloped qualitative analysis. We have found it most productive to treat, and work with, the data as one cohesive dataset, coding, and developing analytic patterns across the entire dataset.
