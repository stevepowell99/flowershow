Future stories This volume is geared to creating social change. It is directed to considering what kind of values should be fostered in society, and implemented through education, for the creation of a better world. This implies prediction of future conditions – as well as presuming that actions taken now will have an impact on those conditions. It therefore includes implicit models of how change in general occurs, becaus [(p. 53)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=53&annotation=highlight-p1x77y104)

prescription; these are the values that will create our better future, our future fourishing as individuals and communities. They are the values that will enable us to overcome the ills and problems [(p. 54)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=54&annotation=highlight-p2x77y603)

When we formulate future value ideals, we draw upon current beliefs about what will best help individual fourishing, and how that intertwines with community and societal fourishing. This depends in part on what we see as contemporary defcits; what gaps in our current lives can be overcome in future? In some cases that amounts to “moral panic” – as originally proposed by Stanley Cohen 50 years ago (Cohen, 1973). A moral panic is a social phenomenon, pattern of behaviour or belief system that is seen as a threat to the status quo, undermining society as we believe it should [(p. 54)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=54&annotation=highlight-p2x77y459)

In this chapter I argue for understanding values as resting upon narratives, and that changing values means changing the narrative. The chapter builds on a paper by Haste and Chopra (2020/2021) which was commissioned by UNESCO as part of their Education Futures 2050 initiative. A value is the orientation to an object, or a goal, that is associated with positive or negative affect, and often with personal identity. A narrative is the story which underpins the value and gives it legitimacy. [(p. 54)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=54&annotation=highlight-p2x77y327)

What is narrative – and why is a narrative more than a theory? A narrative is a story. It includes causal features and agents that account for the current state of affairs; why things are as they are now, and how they became so. This includes implying praise or blame.

Future stories 55 the current state of affairs are normative expressions – this is how things should be, or inevitably are, and how that normative state may, or should, be maintained. Alternatively, if a narrative is blaming, it shows how and why this state of affairs needs changing [(p. 55)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=55&annotation=highlight-p3x77y591)

Further, he pointed out that we only understand what is meant in a statement when we see what it is arguing against; what covert narrative is being countered by what we are hearing? [(p. 55)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=55&annotation=highlight-p3x77y471)

Indeed, we are able in early childhood to follow, and remember, a story long before we develop the capacity for logic. Also, we are highly skilled in using and interpreting narratives. We are storytellers not just puzzle-solvers. [(p. 55)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=55&annotation=highlight-p3x77y219)

There is a longstanding distinction, found in many felds (including for example geology) between seeing change as gradual and slowly transformative, and seeing it as sudden, even cataclysmic, and involving profound alterations in structures and explanations – indeed “ruptures” (Eldredge & Gould, 1985, Stenner, 2017) [(p. 55)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=55&annotation=highlight-p3x77y87)

>[!quote|#ffff00]

In education generally I would argue that there is a strong tendency to perceive change not only as gradual but as in general progressive – and therefore we tend to view our efforts with optimism. This is consistent with a broader, generally “liberal”, socio-political perspective: incremental change, inspired by “good” people and policies, always leads us forward [(p. 56)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=56&annotation=highlight-p4x77y555)

Analysis of change (in any domain) indicates that there are three modes, which have different implications for planning, and different kinds of experience and consequence. The systems engineer William Gosling (1994, 2020) described three different modes of change More of the same builds on current practices, [(p. 56)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=56&annotation=highlight-p4x77y411)

Quantity into quality is more diffcult to predict. It is, however, a common pattern of change. As institutions grow, their structure and goals change qualitatively. A village becomes a town, a town becomes a city. [(p. 56)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=56&annotation=highlight-p4x77y315)

Major change, conceived as rupture, even cataclysm, or metaphorically as a ‘knight’s move’ (as in chess), is extremely diffcult to predict, even by expert insiders who at best may see precursors [(p. 56)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=56&annotation=highlight-p4x77y267)

What are the sources of narratives and values, how do they come to be constructed, and changed? The model I want to cite derives from Vygotsky (1978) and Bakhtin (1982) who argued that individual meaning making is embedded within, and in dialectical relationship with, interaction with others in dialogue, such that even when we are functioning as individuals, “inside our heads”, we are replaying dialogue with others, past or future, remembered or anticipated.

Lawrence Kohlberg (1984) studied the development of moral reasoning, over 20 years beginning in the mid nineteen ffties. His sample was 58 young males. His model of reasoning focused on resolving dilemmas around justice, which in line with Kantian traditions was treated as a primary moral value. He built a theory of moral development based on stages of increasing complexity in understanding the relationships between individuals and society, [(p. 60)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=60&annotation=highlight-p8x77y231)

the 1970s, Gilligan (1982), working with the moral reasoning of girls and women, found that they seemed resistant to focusing on justice, preferring instead to resolve the dilemmas in terms of caring and maintaining relationships (see also Haste, 1986). This apparent gender difference in moral priorities was widely discussed, coming as it did at a time of major feminist challenges to male-dominant narratives [(p. 60)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=60&annotation=highlight-p8x77y159)

Behind the “value” of justice, at least within Kohlberg’s model, is a narrative that in a dilemma situation, the participants are separate individuals with different agendas and conficting interests. The goal of the dilemma resolution is to fnd a “just” balance between these conficts. In contrast, the value of caring and responsibility rests on a narrative that people are inevitably conjoined [(p. 60)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6Z5FZYCS?page=60&annotation=highlight-p8x77y87) %% end annotations %%
