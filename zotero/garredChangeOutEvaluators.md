Retrieved 18 May 2025, from [https://jliflc.com/resources/change-inside-and-out-an-evaluators-guide-to-outcome-harvesting-attitude-change/](https://jliflc.com/resources/change-inside-and-out-an-evaluators-guide-to-outcome-harvesting-attitude-change/)

This Guide updates the learning on Outcome Harvesting + Attitude Change (OH+AC), an adapted version of Outcome Harvesting (OH) that adds the consideration of attitudes while upholding OH’s primary concepts and core principles. Whereas OH centers behavior change among social change actors, attitudes can be a valuable addition to OH wherever inner transformation is essential... Read more »

ems theory pioneer Donella Meadows defnes mental models broadly, including assumptions, values and beliefs. In other words, “mental models” in systems theory hold roughly the same meaning as “attitudes” in OH+AC (and in social psychology). Meadows argues that mental models are not just any part of the system, but actually the most infuential part of the system. Mental models may be the most strategic place to intervene within a system in order to change it. 1 [(p. 13)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRMQLNE?page=13&annotation=highlight-p13x111y417)

Wait a minute: Is knowledge the same as attitude? Colleagues sometimes ask why we include knowledge within the attitudes term, since some capacity development frameworks distinguish knowledge from attitudes. Or they ask why we include both beliefs and values within the attitudes term, since some thinkers consider them to be distinct. Clearly, none of these words mean exactly the same thing! However, OH+AC follows social psychology in defning attitude as a broad, catch-all term [(p. 20)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRMQLNE?page=20&annotation=highlight-p20x132y598)

bility and opportunity refer to the circumstances, incentives and even laws that can make it easier or harder to change a behavior. 25 For example, author Michelle has experienced an AC about animal rights and she aspires to become a vegetarian. However, this would likely result in food insecurity, given her extensive allergies to non-meat protein sources. She lacks the ability to eat a nutritionally complete vegetarian diet, so it is diffcult to change her meat-eating behavior.

Can verbalizing an AC ever become a BC? Yes, in our judgment, sometimes it can. We consider it a BC when a person chooses to talk about a signifcant AC for the frst time in an unprompted manner, especially if it comes at some potential cost to their own emotional comfort or social reputation. 35 For example, after learning about atrocities committed against a minoritized group, a young man from the dominant social group spontaneously stands up in a public gathering to express his feeling of responsibility and remorse. The feeling of responsibility and remorse is, of course, an AC. However, the act of voluntarily articulating in a public setting can be considered a BC th [(p. 34)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRMQLNE?page=34&annotation=highlight-p34x112y521)

What to do with “lone ACs”? You may identify some ACs that do not appear to be related to any BC, and therefore do not ft in any BC Statement row. First, double-check your thinking to be sure that those data bits really are ACs, as opposed to leads on potential BCs that may be discovered through follow-up. Next, all of the data bits that truly are “lone ACs” can be carefully documented in a separate lis [(p. 34)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XGRMQLNE?page=34&annotation=highlight-p34x112y414)
